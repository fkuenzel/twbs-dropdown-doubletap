# Dropdown Doubletap

An extension to the Twitter Bootstrap Dropdown plugin that makes dropdown parent links "double tap to follow".

Inspired by [this](http://osvaldas.info/drop-down-navigation-responsive-and-touch-friendly) and [this](http://osvaldas.info/examples/drop-down-navigation-touch-friendly-and-responsive/doubletaptogo.js). Simply replace the default dropdown.js from Twitter Bootstrap with [js/dropdown-doubletap.js](js/dropdown-doubletap.js).

Currently built against the [v3.3.5 release](https://github.com/twbs/bootstrap/releases/tag/v3.3.5) of Twitter Bootstrap.
